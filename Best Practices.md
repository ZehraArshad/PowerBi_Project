# Best Practices for PowerBI


- Dashboard should be able to scream what is going on. It should facilitate the process of descision making.
- Concise explanations like "In Q4, we made 20% more sales than all the previous quarters combined."
- If we are showing 3 months the sales might be increasing but when we zoom out the sales are terrible.
- If you have a large numbers of repeat buyers, do you even have new buyers?
